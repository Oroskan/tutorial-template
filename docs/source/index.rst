Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**This thing** is a flutter application for assisting in learning
that stores notes, generates challenging questions, and tracks your progress.
It doesn't pull data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
but it does offer a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
